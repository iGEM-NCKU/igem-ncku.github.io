- **Reflection:**
Her insights reminded us to prioritize the “big picture”—communicating our project’s purpose and impact clearly, rather than focusing solely on technical details.
We also realized the importance of planning Human Practices strategically from the beginning, ensuring every interview and outreach effort meaningfully connects to our core project goals.
- **Learning Points:**
    - Presentation & Communication: Focus on clarity and persuasion; judges value how well a team explains its story, not just data.
    - Human Practices Integration: Align every stakeholder interview with the project cycle to demonstrate impact and reflection.
    - Wiki Design: Keep navigation simple and intuitive—information clarity matters more than fancy visuals.
    - Team Management: Build a solid structure early; track progress with clear timelines and delegation to sub-team leaders.
    - Scientific Planning: Develop theoretical logic and modeling backups even when data is limited; strong reasoning can compensate for experimental constraints.
    - Judging Insight: 90% of evaluation relies on the wiki—effective storytelling and accessible presentation are key to success.
