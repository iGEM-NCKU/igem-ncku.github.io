      "Through our surveys and questionnaires, we uncovered a significant gap in the public’s understanding of biofilms, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. This insight led us to make it a priority to **break down the barriers that prevent people from accessing cutting-edge knowledge in these fields**. We realized that many individuals, from high school students to adults, lacked even basic awareness about biofilms and their impact on healthcare, and this knowledge gap needed to be addressed.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "To close this gap, we organized a **comprehensive educational workshop aimed at high school students**. This workshop was designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of biofilms, synthetic biology, and their real-world applications, ensuring that the content was accessible and engaging. At the conclusion of the workshop, we **gathered valuable feedback** from the participants to refine and improve our educational approach. We also sought additional insights to enhance the effectiveness of future educational initiatives.

      "### The Rules of the game\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "We developed an educational tower defense game where the enemies are bacteria equipped with one to three layers of biofilm shields.\n",
      "The bacterial species include *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Mycobacterium*, *Escherichia coli*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Streptococcus*.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "There are two types of defense towers: enzyme towers and antibiotic towers.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Enzyme towers can only target biofilm shields:\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Dispersin B Tower attacks PNAG-based polysaccharide shields.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Proteinase K Tower targets protein shields.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "DNase I Tower breaks down eDNA shields.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Only the outermost shield can be attacked at any given time.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Once a bacterium’s shields are completely destroyed, enzyme towers can no longer deal damage.\n",
      "At this stage, players must deploy antibiotic towers to eliminate the unshielded bacteria.\n",
      "However, antibiotic towers are ineffective until the entire biofilm has been degraded—mimicking how antibiotics cannot penetrate intact biofilms in real infections.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "To simulate the limited persistence of enzymes and antibiotics in the human body, both types of towers automatically disappear after a certain duration.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "The shield compositions are randomly generated to represent the unpredictable structure of natural biofilms.\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "Finally, if a bacterium successfully reaches the end point, a giant biofilm will form at a random location on the map.\n",
      "This represents an established infection site that continuously releases new bacteria—illustrating how uncontrolled biofilm growth leads to persistent infection.\n",

The session emphasized that synthetic biology combines science, creativity, and ethics to solve real-world problems.\\n<br><br>'},\n",
