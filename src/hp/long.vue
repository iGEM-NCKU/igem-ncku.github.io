Educational Game — “Biofilm Breakdown”</b>\n<br> - Co-developed with the Dry Lab team to gamify enzyme–biofilm interactions.\n<br> - Players learn how biofilms form, what enzymes do, and how strategies matter for treatment.\n<br> - The game helped demonstrate the complexity of infection treatment through fun and systems thinking.\n'], ['🔹 After the Activities (Key Insights)', '<br> - We confirmed that <b>educational design can close the communication gap</b> identified in earlier stages.\n<br> - Students and audiences became more confident discussing biofilms and synthetic biology once concepts were linked to <b>real-life examples</b>.\n<br> - Our team also improved our <b>science storytelling skills</b> — learning how to frame content ethically and clearly for non-scientists.\n<br> - Education was not only outreach; it became part of our <b>responsible innovation process</b>, helping us listen, adapt, and respond to society.\n'], ['🔹 Action (Integration into the Project)', '<br> - Education became an official branch of our IHP plan — every outreach activity was tied to an insight from prior interviews (e.g., Prof. Li’s framing, Dr. Hsu’s safety messaging).\n<br> - The <b>workshop and reels</b> directly addressed the public’s top concern (“Is this safe?”) by explaining biosafety principles in approachable ways.\n<br> - The <b>educational game</b> served as both an internal training tool and an external outreach product, reinforcing understanding through interaction.\n<br> - These actions helped us cultivate a <b>two-way dialogue</b> with society — transforming communication from explanation into co-learning.\n<br> - Most importantly, this stage showed that <b>responsible innovation must involve education</b>, not as promotion, but as social engagement and empathy.\n']]}]}, {'title': 'Phase 5-Translation & Future Application', 'reflection': '\nEngaging with technology transfer mentors and regulatory experts allowed us to envision\xa0<i>Byefilm</i>\xa0beyond iGEM — as a\xa0<b>potential biologic adjunct to antibiotic therapy</b>.

The project must first clarify <b>what kind of product it is</b> — “biologic,” “drug,” or “medical device,” because each has different approval pathways.\n<br> - Suggested referring to <b>TFDA and FDA drug/device definitions</b> early to design around the appropriate category.\n<br> - Emphasized the need to build <b>technical credibility and patent strategy</b> before seeking investment.\n<br> - Recommended presenting the project’s value in simple terms: “a biologic that assists antibiotics to clear infections.”\n<br> - Advised against emphasizing “live bacteria” in public documents; instead, focus on <b>enzymatic innovation and safety</b>.\n<br> - Urged the team to visualize the product pipeline — from lab testing → formulation → safety validation → IP filing → startup incubation.\n'], ['🔹 After the Interview (Key Insights)', '<br> - We learned that positioning defines not only how regulators view the product, but also <b>how investors and collaborators perceive it</b>.\n<br> - His suggestion to use the term “biologic adjunct therapy” gave us a realistic framing between “research prototype” and “medical product.”\n<br> - We realized that translation starts with clarity — knowing <i>what problem we solve</i> and <i>who can use it first.</i>\n'], ['🔹 Action (Integration into the Project)', '<br> - Adopted “<b>biologic adjunct to antibiotic therapy</b>” as our official project positioning.\n<br> - Began documenting regulatory definitions (TFDA/FDA) and mapping out potential classification routes.\n<br> - Used Prof. Chiu’s framework to build our <b>technology-to-market roadmap</b> for internal planning.\n<br> -

Many iGEM projects stop after the competition — success depends on whether we have a <b>continuation plan</b> (e.g., Spark, FITI, or national biotech programs).\n<br> - <b>Patent application must precede publication</b>, ideally before presenting results at iGEM.\n<br> - Suggested contacting <b>NCKU’s Frontier Medical Device Center</b> for assistance with prior-art search and patent drafting.\n<br> - Encouraged setting <b>clear milestones</b>: short-term (lab validation), mid-term (patent + proof of concept), long-term (startup or licensing).\n<br> - Highlighted the need to identify the <b>exact “why us”</b> — what makes our enzyme system unique and irreplaceable.\n<br> - Warned that investors will ask: <i>“Why hasn’t this been done before?”</i> — meaning we must clarify both the innovation gap and regulatory rationale.\n'], ['🔹 After the Interview (Key Insights)', '<br> - This discussion helped us recognize that <b>research value ≠ commercialization readiness</b> — we needed to document deliverables and IP potential clearly.\n<br> - We learned how to communicate our project in <b>investor language</b>: focus on unmet clinical need, unique mechanism, and credible roadmap.\n<br> - The importance of pre-filing patents before disclosure became a concrete operational task.\n'], ['🔹 Action (Integration into the Project)', '<br> - Drafted our first <b>IP planning timeline</b>, scheduling pre-filing consultation before iGEM presentation.\n<br> - Incorporated Dr. Lin’s advice into our <b>Dream Come True proposal revision</b>, focusing on feasibility and sustainability.\n<br> - Reframed Byefilm as a <b>long-term translational platform</b> rather than a one-time project.\n<br> -
