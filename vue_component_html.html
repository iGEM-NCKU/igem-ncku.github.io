            With global aging accelerating, <b>degenerative joint diseases</b> 
            have become one of the leading causes of disability. Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) — 
            an artificial knee replacement — is often the last and most effective solution for 
            restoring mobility and quality of life.

            However, beneath this surgical success lies a hidden threat:<br>
            <b>Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI)</b> — an infection that forms around the 
            implant surface after surgery. Although its incidence is only around 
            <em>0.5–2%</em>, once it occurs, it leads to catastrophic consequences such as 
            <b>repeated surgeries, long-term antibiotic use, chronic pain, or even amputation</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The main culprit is <b>biofilm formation</b> — a structured bacterial community 
            encased in a protective extracellular matrix made of 
            <b>polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA)</b>. 
            Once established, biofilms block antibiotics and immune responses, turning a 
            treatable infection into a chronic, relapsing one.
